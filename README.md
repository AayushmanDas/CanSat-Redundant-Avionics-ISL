# CanSat-Redundant-Avionics-ISL

**1. Project Summary:**

The design and development of the CanSat successfully demonstrated the
integration of dual-modular redundancy within a constrained 160mm airframe.
By utilizing a parallel electronic architecture and a mechanically redundant
slotted-latch system, the mission profile achieves a significantly higher reliability
coefficient compared to single-MCU designs.

**2. Key Achievements:**

● System Independence: Successfully isolated Primary and Secondary
systems across independent power rails and processing units.

● Mechanical Innovation: Developed a single-fault tolerant parachute
release mechanism that eliminates the risk of servo-jamming through a
slotted pin interface.

● Mass Efficiency: Optimized the internal structural integrity using
honeycomb weight-reduction pocketing, ensuring the 88mm PCB
assembly remains flight-worthy while minimizing total mass.

● Prototyping Proficiency: Successfully transitioned from breadboard-level
concepts to bare ESP32-WROOM module integration and advanced 3D
CAD modeling.
